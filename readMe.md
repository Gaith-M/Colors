# Colors
## React based project. it aims to provide (as time of creation):
- Random color palette generator
- Color palette generator utilizing color harmonies

**The aim of this project is to advance my React skills and become more familiar with the library and its ecosystem**
This repo only contains the frontend of the project

As of now one feature is almost complete. the random color generator is almost done. currently it offers:
- Generate random colors (by pressing space bar)
- User can have up to 6 colors at once
- Colors can be locked to save them during generating new random colors
- Colors can be edited ( for the time being )
- User can quickly create shades and tints of current colors
- Generated colors have their HEX value represented

Left to do:
- I wanted to display color name in addition to its value, but I couldn't find any proper library that can name colors based on their values
- Add color rearrange functionality so users can place colors in whichever order they want
- Add other means to display color values in addition to HEX (HSL and RGB)
- Add copy to clipboard functionality to facilitate copying color values

By this the first feature would be completed
